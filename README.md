## Overview
The Diabetes Prediction App utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health metrics. The app is user-friendly and allows for interactive input of features.

## Demo App
You can try out the live demo of the app here:

## Streamlit App

## Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.6 or later)
Streamlit
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn

## Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/ajit267/diabetes_prediction_ml.git
Run the App

#Navigate to the directory where the app is located and run the following command:

bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
This will start a local server, and you can view the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

## Features of the App
# Data Input: Users can input their health metrics such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age using sliders.

# Data Visualization: The app provides a scatter chart to visualize the relationship between BMI and Blood Pressure.

# Model Training and Prediction: The app trains a Random Forest Classifier on the diabetes dataset and provides predictions based on user input.

# Probability Display: The app shows the probability of the user having diabetes and displays the result dynamically.
